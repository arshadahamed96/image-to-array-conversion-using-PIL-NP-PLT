#Image to Array Conversion Using PIL, NumPy, and Matplotlib
**Project Overview**
This project demonstrates how to convert an image into a numerical array using the Pillow (PIL) library, along with NumPy for array manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization. The main focus is on transforming images into arrays and performing slicing operations on these arrays to manipulate specific regions of the image.

**Key Objectives**
Image to Array Conversion: Load an image and convert it into a multidimensional NumPy array for analysis and manipulation.
**Array Slicing:** Perform slicing on the image array to isolate and manipulate specific sections of the image.
**Image Visualization:** Use Matplotlib to visualize both the original and sliced images.
Libraries Used
PIL (PYTHON IMAGING LIBREARY): For loading and manipulating images.
NumPy: For converting images to arrays and performing slicing operations.
Matplotlib: For visualizing the original and manipulated images.
